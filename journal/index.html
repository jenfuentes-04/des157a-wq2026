                <h3>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h3>
                <time datetime="2026-02-09">February 9th, 2026</time>
                <p>The article <a href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">"10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills"</a> really resonated with me because I'm one of those students who struggles with slowing down. I tend to skim through things quickly because focusing on details is difficult for me. What stood out most was the idea of approaching visual analysis like a detective game, similar to "I Spy." Framing it as a playful challenge rather than an academic task makes it feel much more engaging. I also appreciated the open-ended questioning method with no right or wrong answers. That kind of approach would definitely make me more comfortable sharing my observations and ideas.</p>
                <p>While exploring <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards</a>, I came across <a href="https://sleep-well-creatives.com/">Sleep Well Creatives</a>, and the experience was genuinely impressive. The site combines smooth animations, interactive scrolling, and ambient sound to create something that actually held my attention. For once, I found myself reading the content carefully instead of rushing through it. It demonstrates how thoughtful visual design can encourage the kind of slow observation the article discusses, making you want to notice details rather than forcing you to.</p>
                <p>However, I recognize this approach has its drawbacks. The layered visuals, constant movement, and background music could easily become overwhelming for some users. It made me think about how visual thinking strategies work differently for everyone. What helps me focus and slows me down might distract or overstimulate someone else.</p>

                <h3>Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</h3>
                <time datetime="2026-01-28">January 28th, 2026</time>
                <p>Before reading this <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">article</a>, I had never heard the term “modal window,” even though I see them all the time. Once it was explained, it immediately reminded me of ads that pop up when I’m playing a game on my phone. They block the screen and won’t let me continue until I interact with them, which made it easier for me to understand how modals work in real life.</p>
                <p>I learned that modal windows can actually be helpful when used correctly. They’re meant to grab the user’s attention, ask for input, or show important information without sending the user to a different page. I also didn’t realize how many details go into designing a good modal, like having a clear title, buttons that actually explain what they do, and an obvious way to close out of it. The sizing and placement tips stood out to me too, especially how modals can be tricky on mobile if they’re too big or too small.</p>
                <p>At the same time, the article made it clear that modals aren’t always the best option. They interrupt the user’s flow and can become annoying if overused. Overall, it feels like modal windows can be really effective, but only when they’re used thoughtfully and with the user’s experience in mind.</p>

                <h3>Best Practices for Form Design</h3>
                <time datetime="2026-01-19">January 19th, 2026</time>
                <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best practices for form design"</a> was surprisingly interesting and helpful to read as a designer. It really made me think more deeply about how much form design affects whether someone actually wants to finish filling it out. If a form feels confusing, too long, or poorly organized, it is very easy for users to give up. People naturally prefer forms that are clear, simple, and easy to understand, which is why design choices matter so much in this context.</p>
                <p>Reading through the twenty tips to improve form usability was especially interesting. While I have thought about ways to improve forms before, seeing all the tips clearly explained in one place helped me better understand how small design choices can make a big difference. This article is something I would want to come back to in the future when designing forms. The three tips that stood out to me the most were using multiple steps, clearly explaining why sensitive information is being asked for, and providing a “show password” option. I personally appreciate knowing how many steps a form will take, and I feel more comfortable sharing private information when the reason is clearly stated. Being able to see a password also helps reduce mistakes and frustration.</p>
                <p>A website form that I think does a good job following these best practices is <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/welcome?welcomeStep=hdyhau">Duolingo’s welcome form</a>. The process is straightforward, visually engaging, and easy to complete. It also shows clear progress indicators, which makes the form feel less overwhelming and more enjoyable to finish.</p>
