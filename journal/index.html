                <h3>Visual Thinking Analysis</h3>
                <time datetime="2026-02-10">February 10th, 2026</time>

                <h4>Part One: My Classmate's Photo</h4>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/wall.jpg" alt="wall">
                    <figcaption>Kenny Yu, 2026</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Kenny’s photo shows a dent in his wall, it’s circular, like something round hit it, and you can see where the white paint cracked from the impact. The wall has that orange peel texture that’s pretty common in houses. Honestly, what makes this image interesting isn’t really the dent itself, but thinking about how it got there. Was it an accident? Did someone throw something? The mystery of it is kind of cool.</p>
                <p>The most obvious thing is that yeah, it’s just a wall with a dent. But the mysterious part is the story behind it, when did this happen? What caused that specific circular shape? Kenny mentioned he wants to make this fun by coming up with wild, creative scenarios for how each dent happened. One idea he told me about was a rhino running into the wall, which is hilarious and definitely makes the project more interesting than just documenting damage.</p>
                <p>My suggestion would be to really lean into that creative storytelling angle, but also think about the photography itself. Right now it’s pretty straightforward documentation. What if you zoomed way in on the dent so we can really see all the details, the texture, the cracks, the layers of paint? That could make it feel less like a snapshot and more intentional. Playing with lighting might help too, like shooting when shadows make the dent more dramatic. The bizarre stories will definitely help make it less ordinary, but the images themselves could push further visually.</p>
                
                <h4>Part Two: My Photo</h4>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/market.jpeg" alt="market">
                    <figcaption>Jennifer Fuentes, 2025</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>This mercado photo is one I’m really excited about because it feels so authentic to my experience growing up Mexican. You can see the Mexican flag, the papel picado (those colorful cut paper banners), and the whole setup of an indoor market. What you can’t tell just from looking at it is how alive these places are, mercados are always packed with people, loud, busy. Mexican families go almost every day, so it’s not like a once-in-a-while thing. It’s part of daily life.</p>
                <p>This image fits perfectly with my project because I’m documenting Mexican culture through my own experiences. I’ve been going to mercados my whole life (not this specific one, but mercados in general), and they represent something really central to the culture. My collection is basically showing parts of who I am as a Mexican person, the places and traditions that shaped me growing up.</p>
                <p>I’m not totally sure how I’d update this image to make it more compelling. Maybe zoom in a bit more? But honestly, I kind of like it how it is. It captures the whole atmosphere of the space, the decorations, the scale of it, the authentic market feel. I think it works.</p>

                <h3>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h3>
                <time datetime="2026-02-09">February 9th, 2026</time>
                <p>The article <a href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">"10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills"</a> really resonated with me because I'm one of those students who struggles with slowing down. I tend to skim through things quickly because focusing on details is difficult for me. What stood out most was the idea of approaching visual analysis like a detective game, similar to "I Spy." Framing it as a playful challenge rather than an academic task makes it feel much more engaging. I also appreciated the open-ended questioning method with no right or wrong answers. That kind of approach would definitely make me more comfortable sharing my observations and ideas.</p>
                <p>While exploring <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards</a>, I came across <a href="https://sleep-well-creatives.com/">Sleep Well Creatives</a>, and the experience was genuinely impressive. The site combines smooth animations, interactive scrolling, and ambient sound to create something that actually held my attention. For once, I found myself reading the content carefully instead of rushing through it. It demonstrates how thoughtful visual design can encourage the kind of slow observation the article discusses, making you want to notice details rather than forcing you to.</p>
                <p>However, I recognize this approach has its drawbacks. The layered visuals, constant movement, and background music could easily become overwhelming for some users. It made me think about how visual thinking strategies work differently for everyone. What helps me focus and slows me down might distract or overstimulate someone else.</p>

                <h3>Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</h3>
                <time datetime="2026-01-28">January 28th, 2026</time>
                <p>Before reading this <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">article</a>, I had never heard the term “modal window,” even though I see them all the time. Once it was explained, it immediately reminded me of ads that pop up when I’m playing a game on my phone. They block the screen and won’t let me continue until I interact with them, which made it easier for me to understand how modals work in real life.</p>
                <p>I learned that modal windows can actually be helpful when used correctly. They’re meant to grab the user’s attention, ask for input, or show important information without sending the user to a different page. I also didn’t realize how many details go into designing a good modal, like having a clear title, buttons that actually explain what they do, and an obvious way to close out of it. The sizing and placement tips stood out to me too, especially how modals can be tricky on mobile if they’re too big or too small.</p>
                <p>At the same time, the article made it clear that modals aren’t always the best option. They interrupt the user’s flow and can become annoying if overused. Overall, it feels like modal windows can be really effective, but only when they’re used thoughtfully and with the user’s experience in mind.</p>

                <h3>Best Practices for Form Design</h3>
                <time datetime="2026-01-19">January 19th, 2026</time>
                <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best practices for form design"</a> was surprisingly interesting and helpful to read as a designer. It really made me think more deeply about how much form design affects whether someone actually wants to finish filling it out. If a form feels confusing, too long, or poorly organized, it is very easy for users to give up. People naturally prefer forms that are clear, simple, and easy to understand, which is why design choices matter so much in this context.</p>
                <p>Reading through the twenty tips to improve form usability was especially interesting. While I have thought about ways to improve forms before, seeing all the tips clearly explained in one place helped me better understand how small design choices can make a big difference. This article is something I would want to come back to in the future when designing forms. The three tips that stood out to me the most were using multiple steps, clearly explaining why sensitive information is being asked for, and providing a “show password” option. I personally appreciate knowing how many steps a form will take, and I feel more comfortable sharing private information when the reason is clearly stated. Being able to see a password also helps reduce mistakes and frustration.</p>
                <p>A website form that I think does a good job following these best practices is <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/welcome?welcomeStep=hdyhau">Duolingo’s welcome form</a>. The process is straightforward, visually engaging, and easy to complete. It also shows clear progress indicators, which makes the form feel less overwhelming and more enjoyable to finish.</p>
